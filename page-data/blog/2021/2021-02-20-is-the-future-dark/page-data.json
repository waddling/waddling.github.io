It was quite depressing and honestly intimidating to learn how much of the hacker community evolved into money-hungry, fame-seeking corporates. I found great interest in hacking in high school; anything new about computers that I learned in my classes, whether it be creating basic websites with HTML, learning about classes in Java, or creating query functions for databases, I just found so much enjoyment doing those activities. Yet, I joined Notre Dame initially as a chemical engineer. I understood that computer science had great prospects and had a growing demand in the job market, but my greatest fear was (and to some degree, still is today) turning some hobby that I really enjoy into professional work that I would not enjoy as much anymore. Over this past week, many of my non-computer science engineering friends had absolutely criticized computer science majors as \\u201Cfake engineers\\u201D mainly because we don\\u2019t have senior design, but I think to outsiders, computer science seems like an \\u201Ceasy way\\u201D to make money; all one has to do is fiddle around on their machines and voila, money.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It was interesting to see Ken Williams fall into the hacker mentality for some time (until before his company grew too big). Ken Williams remind me of many members of the computer science community at Notre Dame who didn\\u2019t join computer science out of pure passion, but because it promised high salary and high hiring rates out of college. Although money and a job security initially brought in more people into the computer science world, I believe that many of those people greatly found enjoyment and perhaps even developed a strong passion for hacking away at a computer. I do think, however, that the Hacker Ethic cannot fully survive in the technology industry. Not everyone is going to be pouring their hearts into different projects or be able to publish software with \\u201Cperfect code\\u201D. Many products today are shipped with tons and tons of bugs, whether it be a program that is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, or a game that has been developing for over nine years. Ultimately, companies these days that deliver commercial software need to satisfy customers\\u2019 needs\\u2014and those customers\\u2019 needs cannot be waiting forever. Ken Williams unfortunately realized that business could not be run as some summer camp with loud parties, drugs, and sex in the office space. That is the reason why he decided to slowly replace the more \\u201Creal hackers\\u201D with those who were more \\u201Cprofessional\\u201D and created programs not through improvisation, but flowcharts and careful planning.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The third generation of hackers seems like a bunch of teenagers who finally realized that it was time to grow up. I feel that more and more, my focus is unfortunately starting to shift towards making money. I cannot simply hack, create programs, and play videogames without having a concern for my future. It genuinely scares me that during my time in industry, I might become some programmer who toils away from 9am to 5pm every day with no real purpose but money for several years.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","frontmatter":{"title":"Is the future dark?  :/","date":"February 20th, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021/2021-02-20-is-the-future-dark/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1518425861","2744905544"]}
