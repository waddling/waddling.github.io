From a high school teenager who had written only two or three programs before, I have in the past four years have grown as a hacker who had now participated in countless projects. Yet, during those years, I don\\u2019t think I had yet the chance to experience the bazaar model of software development, and therefore, I do not think that I can really declare which model (cathedral or the bazaar) as a superior development model.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"As someone who really likes to own his code, I did not really think that I would enjoy creating software with different people. I had mentioned in one of my previous blogs about how in the past, I wouldn\\u2019t even enjoy the cathedral model of development\\u2014I only enjoyed developing something alone. This honestly seems quite sad if you think about it, but I genuinely enjoyed just trying to figure out and learn new things on my own. It was like my personal adventure that I had to complete\\u2014a single-player game.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"However, I have realized from some really great teammates that I had that you can learn new things more quickly and fix things more quickly when you are collaborating with different people. I think one thing that may have deterred me from working with others in the past is the fact that I wasn\\u2019t very familiar with source control and Git. I am by no means a Git guru, but I definitely feel more comfortable with the concept of source control and it has helped me become more willing to collaborate with other people on different projects.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"As ESR mentions in his writings, the cathedral model and the bazaar model aren\\u2019t really mutually exclusive. No project can really \\u201Coriginate in bazaar mode\\u201D. Perhaps there are some exceptions, but software needs to be able to be easily added to and tested on before released as \\u201Cbazaar mode\\u201D. This is why I think, although I had not really dabbled in participating in projects in bazaar mode, that each model of software development is superior in its own way. The bazaar mode would not really be ideal for a small project; I would imagine it would create a too many cooks in the kitchen scenario. However, once a project gets too big, the cathedral model would still function properly, but the bazaar model would definitely see more rapid development and progress.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"However, personally, if I had the choice, I would prefer the bazaar model over the cathedral model because the bazaar model gives me the freedom to step away from a project and return when I feel like returning. It is already designed to be able to pass down to other people who have gained interest and passion for that project. The cathedral model would not grant this freedom easily, since you would be one of the few important members on a team working on a project (or you wouldn\\u2019t even be able to make many contributions if you are an outside party). As a current believer in decentralized systems like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, I believe in the bazaar-style of development. (But I am not necessarily hating on Cathedral-style either, just to make that clear. It\\u2019s just like building keyboards, everything is about personal preference.)\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","frontmatter":{"title":"Apples or Bananas?
