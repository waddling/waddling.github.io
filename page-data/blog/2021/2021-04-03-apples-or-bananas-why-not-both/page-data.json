He truly believes that technology has decreased the gap between the rich and the poor \\u201Cmaterially\\u201D and \\u201Csocially\\u201D. This is simply not true\\u2014maybe it is in the sense that the rich don\\u2019t ride around in horses and everyone rides a car these days, but the rich definitely has so many more luxuries and access to convenient services that the poor does not have. Amazon Prime, for example, is a service that everyone seems to have for convenience, but this is not the case for very low-income families. Food deserts are still a genuine problem in the United States and so many families still worry about how they will prepare their next meal.

It is the sad reality that the majority of the people will not simply be pursuing innovation (i.e., in the field of environmental science), to become humanity\\u2019s hero and save the world. If there was money in solving the problem of climate change, however, we as a human species would have made much more headway than we have already done.
