Unlike the almost-toxically exclusive hacker groups of the northeast who segregated people who they deemed \\u201Closers\\u201D from the \\u201Cwinners\\u201D, the hardware hackers in the west coast were more focuses on the sharing of knowledge than putting others down for bringing no contributions to the group. The biggest difference between the two groups would be that the \\u201Ctrue hackers\\u201D did not really seem to have a true passion for expanding their community\\u2014their community was more about being a safe haven for the socially disconnected but logically intelligent. On the other hand, the \\u201Chardware hackers\\u201D really had a passion for keeping the computer and also the software technology decentralized for the people. They recognized the potential of the computer and made it their mission to spread it to the regular person. This mindset was quite evident through their Homebrew Computer Club meetings, where all the hardware hackers would share their knowledge than boast about their knowledge. New software was copied from tape to tape and disseminated during these meetings as well.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Even if the two hacker groups had different mindsets, they both took the Hacker Ethic to their hearts. Both groups seriously believed in learning things by doing and trying new things, in the freedom of information, and decentralization of technology. They both saw the world of computers as blank canvases on which they could paint whatever they want. Hacker Ethics strive towards a judgment-free Utopia and impossibly ideal world; hindsight and history rather clearly show how it was not really the \\u201Ctrue hackers\\u201D or the \\u201Chardware hackers\\u201D that are remembered by the world, but it\\u2019s those who changed the world by applying the things that the hackers developed. The famous Bill Gates and the late Steve Jobs would definitely not be considered accepted as \\u201Ctrue hackers\\u201D in the hacker community. (Maybe they were accepted at some point before they succeeded as the pioneers of new technology.) Bill Gates, after creating BASIC for the Altair 8800, makes a really good point in his letter to all hackers that software, not just hardware, should be protected from theft. This view, however, directly goes against hacker ethics in that information should be free. But it definitely seems true that if there were copyright laws for authors, there should be protection of software which could be considered as intellectual property. Steve Jobs also realized that capitalizing on the building and dissemination of the Apple and Apple II was going to put him on the pathway to great wealth. Jobs realized early that he could bring computers to not just hackers but a whole new audience; he could monetize the process. The regular person today definitely remembers Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, not Steve Wozniak or Steve Dompier.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"When trying to create a large impact on the world, it only seems necessary to abandon parts of hacker ethics, because the entire world is not going to be believing in hacker ethics. Not everyone believes to mistrust authorities and that you learn only by doing. It seems too far-fetched and delusional to believe for a second that the entire world could be impacted by simply sticking to the hacker ethics. It is such a painful sentence for me to type because I truly wish that it could be just that easy to make the world a better place.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","frontmatter":{"title":"Can I be a rich \"true hacker\"?","date":"February 13th, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021/2021-02-13-can-i-be-a-rich-true-hacker/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1518425861","2744905544"]}
