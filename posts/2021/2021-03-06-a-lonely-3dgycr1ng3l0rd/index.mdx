Short backstory, I used to play this videogame called [Maplestory](https://maplestory.nexon.net/). It is a 2D platform MMORPG and I had a great time fighting bosses with my guildmates and friends. My gamertag was [EdgyCringe](https://maplestory.gg/c/gms/EdgyCringe) because I thought it was a funny and satirical meme name.

If EdgyCringe was a real person that was essentially an embodiment of the name, he might as well be Paul Graham. From his essays, Paul Graham sounds like he has a lot to complain about in life and seems to emit this high and lofty kind of aura. His version of a hacker is somewhat in line with Steven Levy’s “hacker” in the sense that they both are not socially appreciated: they are the outcasts of society, the lowest rung of the popularity ladder, the unlikable nerds—but they do not really care about their social status. The hackers’ main focus is to create and design things rather than to spend energy trying to appeal to the other people who do not recognize how stupid and meaningless is their desire for recognition and popularity.

Honestly, I do not wish to be that kind of hacker that Graham and Levy envisions. They have the belief that being truly smart, genius, and innovative cannot really coexist with having many friends or being popular and in a sense, perhaps that is true—it might genuinely be difficult to empathize with other people who clearly think and imagine on a different wavelength.

When I am asked to work on group projects, although I understand that in the real world, most work is done collaboratively, I am really reluctant to work together for several reasons: 1. It seems so much of a hassle to align schedules and ideas. 2. I am often unsatisfied with other people’s coding styles and prefer my own style of developing and planning. 3. Working alone come with less stress because I can work at my own pace and if I fail, the failure affects only me and not others as well. 4. It just feels more efficient to be doing all the thinking, planning, coding, and testing myself in one streamlined process. Yet, when I do get to working together with people, while I still think sometimes that it requires more time (and therefore less “efficient”), there are precious memories I make by stressing together over code that doesn’t work, or brainstorming while ideas and bouncing them off each other, or sharing the moment when we finally get something to work and it’s celebratory. And I wholehearted embrace those moments that make up my coding days in college.

I like to think that I am smart. Not in a conceited and vain kind of way, but more in a “I believe in myself” kind of way. Perhaps I’m not at that “genius” level of intelligence where I would have trouble getting along and socializing with other people. I really enjoy the friendships I have developed through working together and if becoming a “hacker” means I have to forgo of that, then so be it. I guess I’ll just not be that kind of hacker. Actually, since being a hacker sounds cool, I think I’ll be a hacker, but just really disagree with their definitions of a “hacker”.
