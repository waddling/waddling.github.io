The world of technology is constantly changing; hardware, software, and operating systems feel outdated after only three or four years of use. This is the reason that the best skill a hacker could have is the ability to learn quickly and adapt since everything around them is developing so rapidly. It logically makes sense that hackers are naturally attracted to open-source development because in order for projects to remain useful, it must be maintained.

We’re all going to die one day, but our names, legacy, and contributions to the world far outlive us. I think this is one giant appealing aspect of open-source development—the fact a project you have worked on will continue to be of service even after you leave it. Open source, simply put, is people inventing ideas together and everyone receiving credit for their contribution. And these inventions will be essentially future-proofed if there is a significant community backing and maintaining it.

Open source is also very attractive to giant companies. We saw how the biggest contributors to the Linux Kernel, for example, were the top contributors. I think there is no reason companies shouldn’t hire open-source developers to contribute to open-source projects that they believe will significantly help developing the company. Take NVIDIA and their graphics cards as an example. NVIDIA will attract so many more customers if their hardware is super compatible and optimized for various open-source operating systems. Large corporations can also market themselves as more friendly to the general public by claiming to not monopolize software by contributing to open source. It definitely seems like an easy way to increase positive sentiment about that particular company that contributes to open source.

I’ll be completely honest, I personally still feel like I don’t yet fully comprehend what open source is and how open source operates, but from the little amount I do know about open source, I love it. The idea that no one company can have a full monopoly on one type of program is being fully realized through community backed open source. You cannot stop a group of passionate people from continuing what other companies may have abandoned or start taking projects in a different direction. My freshman year roommate and current close friend is the biggest Mario Kart Wii nerd. He explained to me in lengthy detail how Nintendo dropped support for online play for the Nintendo Wii which resulted in passionate players to spin up their own servers for the community after reverse engineering the Wii. The Mario Kart Wii community still stands strong, featuring custom tracks and faster cars. (Although the code base for this project is not completely open, it was an effort by a community based online.)

There are many ways that open-source development can stay alive. Recently, from personal experience, it seems that more people are realizing that it may be worth forgoing a Starbucks Frappuccino to donate five dollars to people or projects they support. More and more smaller projects that may not have giant companies backing them will survive through the generosity from donors and sponsors.
