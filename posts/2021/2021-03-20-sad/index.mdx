I am a hypocrite, I think. After some minutes of self-reflection, I think I’m a hypocrite. The readings and what we have discussed as a class made me realize that in some ways, I don’t want to be someone who only pursues generating wealth and not the life around them. But I feel that, in the future, that is exactly what I’ll end up becoming. But then again, I don’t think I mind that too much? I’m not too sure, yet. Maybe I’m just unnecessarily worrying about those things and I will simply stay as someone who will always value family and friendship over wealth and money.

Paul Graham feels like to me as a very similar person as Ken Williams—they both seem to have this possessed aura of obsessing over the idea of wealth. I hate the fact that most people in the world is focused on making/generating wealth and it certainly feels like we as a human species have developed this kind of society where the goal is…I don’t even know. What do people live for? Maybe that’s the point. Maybe people are all so smart and have realized that there is not much to live for, which is why they focus on creating wealth because everyone realizes that it is easy to forget to even consider the meaning of life when you’re dousing in your warm infinity pool gazing across into the mountains in the backyard of your mansion and your butler just brought you another cool glass of some elegant cocktail.

At first glance, Paul Graham essay, “Mind the Gap”, sounded absolutely ludicrous. He states that although technology has “increase[d] the gap in income”, it has decreased other gaps and as a result, the rich live more like an average person. He truly believes that technology has decreased the gap between the rich and the poor “materially” and “socially”. This is simply not true—maybe it is in the sense that the rich don’t ride around in horses and everyone rides a car these days, but the rich definitely has so many more luxuries and access to convenient services that the poor does not have. Amazon Prime, for example, is a service that everyone seems to have for convenience, but this is not the case for very low-income families. Food deserts are still a genuine problem in the United States and so many families still worry about how they will prepare their next meal. Paul Graham, in this essay, sounds like a naïve child with an extremely narrow view of the world.

Unfortunately, however, I do agree with his point that some gap in income must exist to make the world a “better” place. There needs to be a motivating factor for people to pursue innovation, and nothing is better than money. It is the sad reality that the majority of the people will not simply be pursuing innovation (i.e., in the field of environmental science), to become humanity’s hero and save the world. If there was money in solving the problem of climate change, however, we as a human species would have made much more headway than we have already done. It is because of how much money is available in the tech industry that people are continuing to innovate, because people have recognized that whoever finds the “next big thing” will be making billions of dollars.
