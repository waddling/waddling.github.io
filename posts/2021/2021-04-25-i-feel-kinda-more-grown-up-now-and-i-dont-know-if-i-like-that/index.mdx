title: I feel kinda more grown up now and I don't know if I like that.

I’m not sure how deep I want to go in when discussing my upbringing because there are definitely so many moments in my life so far that I am really ashamed of. And after all, this is the Internet that I am posting my story on. Maybe if my posts were anonymous, I would have more courage to share my whole story, but since it’s not, I will tell only a part of my story.

I enjoy reading and learning about the various upbringings of different people. I may find some aspects of their life inspiring, or I finally get to understand why some people think the way they think. It’s like when you meet your friends’ parents for the first time—you finally get to see their literal roots, in a sense: the mannerisms, the small habits, the way they speak, the humor, etc. And mostly for that reason, I found Linus’s early life interesting.

I’ve always had a love and hate relationship with the computer. I genuinely had so much fun using the computer. For people who somewhat know me, they definitely know that I spend many hours playing videogames. Not many people know however, that I really just like *using* the computer and the Internet. I love organizing files on my Desktop or on my cloud storage. I love setting up my devices together in sync so that my user experience is smooth as a move from one operating system to another operating system. I have so much fun personalizing my online profiles, my videogames characters, the themes on my devices, etc., even when I know that the only person who probably will be looking at it is me. Maybe it’s an addiction, maybe it’s an escape sometimes from things offline that I do not want to do, but I just enjoy sitting in front of the screen and tinkering around with the infinitely many things I can tinker around with. These are just some reasons why I just like the computer (“I just like the stock.”).

I am honestly shocked that my eyes have not burnt out yet. People wonder how I can literally stare at a screen for a full day sometimes, and I really wonder how, too. It is quite obvious that I don’t necessarily have the healthiest lifestyle, and I do definitely hate that part about computers. I genuinely love and value the real-life friendships I have and the memories I make with them. But I recognize the fact that I slip into days of being glued to a screen and I just don’t want to interact with other people, whether it be playing videogames, coding, watching music videos, editing some graphics, or whatever. But because I recognize how the computer really separates me from the real physical world sometimes, I hate the computer in that aspect.

I don’t know yet what I want my story to be. Right now, I feel that I am at a stage where I am still honing my skills and myself as a person. I don’t know what I am getting ready for, but I know that I am getting ready. Whatever interest or passion in the future that I do invest myself in, I just hope that the result is something that I am proud of. This is such a vague statement, but I hope it makes sense. When I end up doing something historical, I hope that people can learn about my story and realize they can do something, too. I’m not some math genius or some crazy coding nerd. I don’t even use Linux that often. I want to prove in the future that the most important thing to achieving something is having a strong will and mindset.

That final statement may come off as super ignorant, and perhaps I am simply naïve.
