Yes. That would be cool. I would like to be able to punish criminals by hacking into their bank accounts or by exposing their secret plans to the media. Yay.

The first chapters of Steven Levy’s “Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution” completely altered my view of what a “hacker” is. Well, not completely. I knew from my few years of exposure of the world of computer science that a “hacker” is not some hooded figure typing away in the dark, trying to punish evil in society. My initial thought of a “hacker” is someone who “hacks” away at code everyday using the various tools at his or her disposal to create something, whatever that something may be. That something could be a program that randomly blurts out obnoxious noises to annoy your roommates, or it could be the military defense system of a country. I still believe that my definition of a “hacker” is what Steven Levy’s “hacker” has evolved to be over time. The only thing that Levy really wishes to emphasize about hackers that would add to my definition of a hacker is the hackers’ code of ethics, general lifestyle, and motivation. A “True Hacker”, according to Levy, focuses less on the implication of his or her work, but more on optimization, efficiency, elegance, cleverness, and innovation. True Hackers constantly strive for a perfect system; they constantly find small faults and imperfections that they wish to improve. They want to improve already working code by making it shorter and more efficient. To Levy’s True Hackers, saying that hacking is a hobby is a serious understatement—hacking is a lifestyle.

If people like Peter Samson, Peter Deutsch, Alan Kotok, Slug Russell, Ricky Greenblatt, and Bill Gosper would be considered the “Founding Fathers” of the hacking community, then these “Founding Fathers” were absolute psychopaths. I understand that the word, “psychopath”, seems quite negative, demeaning, and even may be insulting, but I truly have nothing but respect for these early hackers. It is no mystery that hackers attracted similar people and repelled those who didn’t understand their way of life. It really takes a certain type of people to devote all their energy to hacking. Take Greenblatt, for example, his number one priority was code. Sleep, social life, hygiene, and academics were all nothing but inevitable annoyances for this man. And to me, personally, I find that insane level of passion quite admirable.

Hackers just view the world in a different way. I distinctly remember a moment in the book when Marge Saunders asks her husband Bob to help carry the groceries by saying, “Would you like to help me bring in the groceries?” Bob would always respond “No” because his mind processed the question like a computer. He didn’t want to help bring in the groceries, but if he was asked to do so, he definitely would have helped. This situation really stood out to me since I would always find the smallest technicalities in other people’s sentences (although I wouldn’t constantly point them out unless I was joking around with my close friends, I don’t think I am crazy as the True Hackers to live that way).

The True Hackers, the ones I see as those who founded the hacker’s community, are absolutely insane. And I seriously mean that. The fact that they would dissect Chinese restaurants and their menus like systems seems psychopathic. I will admit that I do not (yet) have the crazed level of passion for code as they do, nor am I willing to sacrifice a healthy lifestyle and great social relationships. However, I also do really mean it when I say that I have the utmost respect for these kind of True Hackers. Not just the ones who hack away at code, but anyone who is driven by an inhuman level of passion.
