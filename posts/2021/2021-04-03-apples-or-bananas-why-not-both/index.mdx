1. Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer’s personal itch
2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
3. Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.
4. If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
5. When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
6. Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
7. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
8. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
9. Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
10. If you treat your beta-testers as if they’re your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
11. The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
12. Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that you concept of the problem was wrong.
13. Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.
14. Any too should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
15. When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible – and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
16. When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
17. A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
18. To solve an interesting problem start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
19. Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

The above are the 19 principles from The Cathedral and the Bazaar, by Eric S. Raymond. I just wanted to list them for my own sake in case I want to reference them at some point in the future.

As I read the first principle, I felt that it was quite an obvious statement: the first principle just seems inherently true because if a developer is starting a project to scratch his or her personal itch, then he or she would naturally be invested in and more passionate about the project, which would often lead to a “good work of software”.

First of all, as I think about my software development experience, it is quite crazy when I actually think about how many projects (big and small) that I had participated in. From a high school teenager who had written only two or three programs before, I have in the past four years have grown as a hacker who had now participated in countless projects. Yet, during those years, I don’t think I had yet the chance to experience the bazaar model of software development, and therefore, I do not think that I can really declare which model (cathedral or the bazaar) as a superior development model.

As someone who really likes to own his code, I did not really think that I would enjoy creating software with different people. I had mentioned in one of my previous blogs about how in the past, I wouldn’t even enjoy the cathedral model of development—I only enjoyed developing something alone. This honestly seems quite sad if you think about it, but I genuinely enjoyed just trying to figure out and learn new things on my own. It was like my personal adventure that I had to complete—a single-player game.

However, I have realized from some really great teammates that I had that you can learn new things more quickly and fix things more quickly when you are collaborating with different people. I think one thing that may have deterred me from working with others in the past is the fact that I wasn’t very familiar with source control and Git. I am by no means a Git guru, but I definitely feel more comfortable with the concept of source control and it has helped me become more willing to collaborate with other people on different projects.

As ESR mentions in his writings, the cathedral model and the bazaar model aren’t really mutually exclusive. No project can really “originate in bazaar mode”. Perhaps there are some exceptions, but software needs to be able to be easily added to and tested on before released as “bazaar mode”. This is why I think, although I had not really dabbled in participating in projects in bazaar mode, that each model of software development is superior in its own way. The bazaar mode would not really be ideal for a small project; I would imagine it would create a too many cooks in the kitchen scenario. However, once a project gets too big, the cathedral model would still function properly, but the bazaar model would definitely see more rapid development and progress.

However, personally, if I had the choice, I would prefer the bazaar model over the cathedral model because the bazaar model gives me the freedom to step away from a project and return when I feel like returning. It is already designed to be able to pass down to other people who have gained interest and passion for that project. The cathedral model would not grant this freedom easily, since you would be one of the few important members on a team working on a project (or you wouldn’t even be able to make many contributions if you are an outside party). As a current believer in decentralized systems like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, I believe in the bazaar-style of development. (But I am not necessarily hating on Cathedral-style either, just to make that clear. It’s just like building keyboards, everything is about personal preference.)
