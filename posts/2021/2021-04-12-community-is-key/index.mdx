Firstly, I have transitioned over from typing with a standard QWERTY layout keyboard to typing with COLEMAK this past Thursday, and it is extremely frustrating that I now have to type in 30 WPM instead of 140 WPM. Honestly, I have no idea why I have decided to make this switch now, but hopefully I’ll be able to break through the 180 WPM barrier in a couple weeks. This blog post will serve as good typing practice.

Anyways, before I start talking about open source, I want to share a short story about my current Discord server with my friends. Back in some point during high school, I decided to introduce many of my friends to a new way to communicate online. My friends and I used to play a lot of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and we would talk in-game all the time. However, CS:GO had only a push-to-talk feature and after many hours of playing, we realized that it would be a lot more fun to talk constantly than just in game. So, I created this Discord server, and my friends and I made up the initial community. Slowly, but surely, the server expanded as we began to invite friends of friends and other random people that we clicked with online.

Within the server, there were various roles with each role having different permissions. I, being the owner of the server had the most power, and my original group of friends also had many permissions—including the ability to kick, ban, mute, deafen, and move members around from one channel to another channel. As one can imagine a group of insecure and edgy high schoolers, much of this power was abused to the point where it was simply not fun to join the server and hang out. As the owner of the server, I revoked everyone’s permissions, but the damage had been done and people were not satisfied that I still had my admin privileges when I had also committed the crime of abusing my powers.

So, what happened next was the creation of a new Discord server by one of the core friends. Everyone who used to be active on the old server was attracted to this fresh start and inevitably, I had to abandon my own server as well. This new server was different. Firstly, every main member had pretty much the same permissions as the owner. Secondly, this new server had a “Rules” section that listed two rules: 1. Don’t be a b****, and 2. The council members know all. Albeit vague, even just the presence of these roles made a difference. The server still runs strong today with 72 members.

In a way, this new server that is now our main server was the result of “forking” the original server. One of my friends was unsatisfied with the management of the old server and acted upon it, and now we have a stronger and healthier community. (Also, the fact that we’ve all matured a lot probably factors in.) Any kind of community, open-source or not, will fail if the person with the most power imposes drastic measures to resolve conflicts. A community is also more likely to thrive if there is a written set of rules or code of conduct.

Open-source communities are definitely a million times more complex than private Discord servers. I think there are two main motivators to why people would contribute to open-source projects: one is the same reason why people donate to charity. Instead of giving money, however, people are giving a lot of time and effort. Another reason may be frustration of a particular bug or some aspect of the project. As many people know, developers often begin projects to scratch some personal itch, and contributing to open-source projects may be to scratch that itch.

It does seem difficult, however, for people to fully commit themselves to open-source. It is definitely far from the life of fame and big money. Or it may also be the case that even if someone likes a certain open-source project, they may not find that community not very attractive.

Honestly, my entire story about my discord server was probably not necessary at all, but I just wanted to share a little bit of my life and I also believe that all communities, in principle are quite similar.
