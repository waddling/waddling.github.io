Hello. I'm not really sure what to write about myself on this page. All I really
want to say is that I started out as a chemical engineering major at my
university and I am really, really glad that I switched into being a computer
science major. I will probably update this page much later at some point in the
future.

My name, "waddling", comes from the fact that I love penguins.
